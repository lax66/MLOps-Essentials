# 2.1: Crop Yeild Dataset (Explanation)

## 1. First: what type of ML problem is this?

Look at the **last column**:

```
Crop_Yield_ton_per_hectare

```

Example values:

```
11.42
23.19
7.94
72.53
6.72
```

👉 These are **numbers (continuous)**.

### ✅ So this is a **REGRESSION problem**

You are predicting:

> “How many tons per hectare will the crop yield be?”
>

## 2. How to read this dataset (human way)

Each **row** = one farming situation

Each **column** = one factor affecting yield

### Soil-related

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| N, P, K | Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium |
| Soil_pH | Acidity/alkalinity |
| Soil_Moisture | Water content |
| Soil_Type | Clay, Sandy, Silt |
| Organic_Carbon | Soil fertility |

---

### Climate-related

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Temperature | °C |
| Humidity | % |
| Rainfall | mm |
| Sunlight_Hours | hours/day |
| Wind_Speed | km/h |

---

### Geography

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Region | North, Central, East |
| Altitude | meters |
| Season | Rabi, Kharif, Zaid |

---

### Farming practice

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Crop_Type | Wheat, Rice, Maize |
| Irrigation_Type | Canal, Rainfed |
| Fertilizer_Used | kg/ha |
| Pesticide_Used | kg/ha |

---

### Target (what you predict)

```
Crop_Yield_ton_per_hectare
```

---

## 3. Why this dataset is GREAT for model serving practice

### ✔ Mixed data types

- Numeric → scaling
- Categorical → encoding
- Perfect for **pipelines**

### Realistic API input

Your API will receive JSON like:

```json
{
"N":132,
"P":62,
"K":22,
"Soil_pH":6.35,
"Soil_Moisture":59.78,
"Soil_Type":"Clay",
"Temperature":22.97,
"Humidity":53.89,
"Rainfall":1305.68,
"Season":"Rabi",
"Crop_Type":"Maize",
"Irrigation_Type":"Canal"
}
```

This is **real-world ML serving**, not toy examples.

---

## 4. What preprocessing will be required (important)

### Numeric columns

- N, P, K
- Rainfall, Temperature, Humidity
- Fertilizer_Used, Pesticide_Used

Scale or pass through

---

### Categorical columns

- Soil_Type
- Region
- Season
- Crop_Type
- Irrigation_Type

One-Hot Encoding

---

## 5. What model should YOU start with (best choice)

### ✅ RandomForestRegressor (simple & strong)

```python
from sklearn.ensembleimport RandomForestRegressor
```

Why:

- Handles non-linear relationships
- No heavy scaling required
- Great baseline

---

### Production-friendly option

- LightGBM / XGBoost (later)

---

## 6. Metrics you should use for this dataset

Since this is **regression**:

✔ RMSE

✔ MAE

✔ R² (optional)

Example explanation:

> “Our model achieved an RMSE of 0.8 tons per hectare, meaning predictions deviate by less than one ton on average.”
> 

---

## 7. What this enables you to practice (important for YOU)

With this dataset you can practice:

- Feature pipelines
- Model versioning
- JSON schema validation
- Multiple serving methods
- Monitoring prediction drift

This is **real MLOps**.
